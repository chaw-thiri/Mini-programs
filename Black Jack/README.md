# Blackjack game
This is a card game where user has to get a total score of 21 or as close as to it to win.
When the user get the ace(11) and king, queen or jack(10), this is called "BLACKJACK" and the user will instantly win.
However, the reverse is true for the computer. 
If no one gets blackjack, individual scores will be compared and those closest to 21 will win.
